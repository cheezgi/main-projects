you are a square
================

As the name of the game implies, you are a square. The controls are WASD, 
and the aim of the game is to try to get the highest score without dying. 
Might implement a highscore system later, but for now, just use a sticky note.
Oh, and try not to touch the red circle.

This project was written in Lua when I was learning the LOVE2D game framework. Really neat.
Go check it out if you have the time.
