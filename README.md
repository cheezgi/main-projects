main-projects
=============

This is just my repo for my main projects, like the pet simulator I'm inactively working on right now or the GUI-based RPG I'm making. 

Feel free to download my stuff. Not that it'll work though. My pet sim was originally in Visual C++ because I use Windows as my default OS, so don't expect it to.

Linux is better for that kind of stuff.

```Aug. 23 2013:``` Just created this repo. Hello, GitHub!  
```Aug. 24 2013:``` Just added my FizzBuzz solution and Pet Simulator.  
```Aug. 27 2013:``` Just added my little chase game. Might make it into a tutorial if I ever get around to it.
