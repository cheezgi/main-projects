fizzbuzz
========

I wrote this in response to a filter that employers use to sift out the people that only know the syntax of 
a programming language. What you have to do is write a program that prints the numbers 1...100 
but for the multiples of three, print "fizz" and for the multiples of five, print "buzz". If the 
number is a multiple of both three and five, print "fizzbuzz". I thought this was hard until I rememered 
the % operator and then I slapped myself.
